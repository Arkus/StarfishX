Release Notes:

Version 2.0 - 07/06/03
======================
* Brand new pattern generating engine! Many, many thanks to Mars Saxman for
writing and sharing this amazing new engine. The Starfish 2.0 engine has about
four times the number of individual generators as the Starfish 1.x generator, so
it will generate some very different (and *VERY* cool) patterns. This new
generator is also Altivec-ready, so it's screamin' fast on a G4 machine.
* New interface on the main window. You can make the window much smaller now.
The controls which were formerly on the "Pattern" and "Advanced" tabs (along
with the New Pattern button) are now in a drawer on the left of the main window,
while the "Recent" controls are now in a drawer on the right. The settings
formerly in the "Control" tab have been moved to the Preferences dialog.
* StarfishX now comes as two separate downloads. One for G4 and higher machines,
and one for G3 machines. This is so that G4 users can realize a 15% performance
improvement over an all-in-one version of StarfishX.
* Copy now works with the currently selected recent pattern. Now you can copy
and paste patterns into other programs!
* Double-clicking on a recent pattern will install that pattern on the main
display (same as typing Command-1).
* Because the new generator does not generate seamless patterns by default, the
Arrange option "Tile" has been changed to "Tile (seamless)" and a "Tile (not
seamless)" options has also been added. If you are generating anything other
than a full-screen pattern, these two settings will control whether or not the
pattern created is seamless or not. (Full-screen patterns are never seamless,
since they won't tiled).
* You can now drag and drop from the recent list into other applications, in
addition to using Edit/Copy to copy the selected pattern to the clipboard. By
default, dragging to the Finder will make an alias to the original file, but you
can hold down the option key to cause the file to be copied to the drag
location.
* Preferences are now organized in tabs, somewhat similar to the tabs used on
the main window in the 1.x version.
* Added a JPEG quality slider to the Advanced tab in the Preferences sheet. You
probably won't want to use anything less than 80% for your desktop.
* TIFF patterns now use LZW compression (lossless) to reduce disk space usage.
* Added drag & drop reordering to the Edit Palettes lists.
* You can now drag from the recent pictures list to the "Next seed:" field, as
well as the "Size:" and "Palette:" popups. Doing so will attempt to set the drag
target to the value used for the recent pattern you are dragging.
* You can now start continuous pattern generation by holding the option key
while pressing the New Pattern button. You can also skip the current pattern and
immediately start generating a new pattern by holding down the option key and
pressing the Stop button. Note that this feature works for single and continuous
pattern generation. The title of the New Pattern/Stop button will change
appropriately when you press/release the option key.
* Because of the above change, the shortcut key for the "Create Until Recent
Cache Full" has been changed from Command-Shift-N to Command-Option-N. This item
will now become "Skip Current Pattern" (with shortcut key of Command-Option-.)
when a pattern is being generated and has the same effect as clicking the Stop
button while holding the option key.
* The recent pattern information (including the thumbnails) are now stored in a
file at "~/Library/Caches/StarfishX Recent Patterns Cache". If you delete this
file, you will cause StarfishX to forget about all recent patterns.
* Preferences are now stored in the org.mscott.starfishx.plist file in
~/Library/Preferences. Old preferences should be automatically migrated from
~/Library/Preferences/StarfishX.plist.
* Added new palettes, "Savannah", "Storm", and "Atlantis". Thanks to S. Rooks!
* Added French localization. Many thanks to Bwass for the translation!


Version 1.5 - 03/31/03
======================
* Added an "Edit" menu to allow for Cut/Copy/Paste
* Fixed bug where Command-N would sometimes stop pattern generation (it should
have been Command-. and now it is).
* Added Command-Shift-N as a shortcut for "Create until recent cache full".
* Added new palette, "Sky". Thanks to Todd S.!
* Moved all the options which were previously on the Advanced tab to the new
Preferences sheet.
* Improved the generation of random numbers.
* You can now seed the random number generator to create the same pattern with
different sizes/palettes. Also, if you find a really cool pattern, other
StarfishX users can create it themselves just by giving them the seed value used
(see FAQ for some caveats).
* Added an option to allow you to specify the exact size of patterns created.
* Added a "random (no full spectrum) option to the palette popup menu.
* Added a badge icon to the StarfishX's dock image while creating patterns.
* Changed "Delete" button on Recent tab to "Trash". StarfishX will now move
files to Trash instead of deleting them immediately (and irreversibly).
* StarfishX will now scan the patterns in the recent patterns cache and
automatically "forget" any patterns which you've moved/deleted from the Desktop
Pictures folder.
* Fixed yet another bug which might cause StarfishX to create non-full-screen
patterns when full-screen is requested.

Version 1.4b2 - 03/18/03
========================
* Change the code so StarfishX will generate a truly full-screen pattern on the
main monitor.

Version 1.4b1 - 03/18/03
========================
* Added an option to automatically check for a newer version of StarfishX when
StarfishX launches.
* Added a "Run at reduced priority" option on the Advanced tab. This is on by
default and will give other processes on your system more time relative to
StarfishX (so it doesn't bring your machine to a grinding halt). This will have
virtually no effect on pattern generation times on an otherwise idle system.
* Fixed a bug which could cause StarfishX to be confused about the size of your
monitor(s).

Version 1.3b1 - 03/13/03
========================
* Each new pattern now has a unique file name. This eliminates the weird
double-set of the desktop when installing the new pattern. It also allows for:
* Added option to keep recent patterns (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 or 500). See the
Read Me file for more information.
* Added a table to review all recent patterns and optionally to manually Save,
Install on desktop, or Delete any recent pattern.
* Added "Pattern" menu with 'Create New Pattern' and 'Create Until "Recent"
Cache Full'.
* Added a line of text under the main image well which indicates the palette
used and size of the pattern selected/being generated.
* Added address and link to StarfishX website in the About StarfishX window.
* The main window can now be closed (and will remain closed on subsequent
launches). This lets StarfishX essentially run as just an icon in the dock. When
the main window is closed, clicking on StarfishX's icon in the Dock will re-open
it. Also, the usual Command-O/W will open and close the main window while
StarfishX is the front-most application.
* Similarly, the "Minimize main window at startup" option has been removed in
favor of simply remembering if the main window was minimized when you last quit
StarfishX. (Note that you can quit StarfishX from its Dock icon by
control-clicking on it.)
* The tab you were last on is now remembered the next time you launch the
program.
* Improved overall performance of a core AltiVec function used by almost all the
generators. You probably won't notice the difference, however, except in some
very rare cases when the generator would actually come to a complete stop.

Version 1.2b2 - 03/05/03
========================
* Fixed a big, nasty memory leak introduced in 1.2b1. Very bad. :-(

Version 1.2b1 - 03/05/03
========================
* Added palette editing. See the Read Me file for more information.
* Added six new default palettes: Aqua, USA, Halloween, Christmas, Easter, and
Bronco
* The "random" palette option now includes "full-spectrum" in the list of
possible palettes.
* Cleaned up timer options to reset time when you change the time interval.
* Fixed a small memory leak when running multi-threaded.
* Other minor code clean-up as I learn more about Cocoa. :-)

Version 1.1b1 - 02/26/03
========================
* Added timer options to automatically generate new patters after specified time
period. (Provided you leave the program running.)
* Added dock menu with option to start/stop pattern generation.
* The position and size of the main window are now remembered between launches.
* When the main window is minimized, the dock icon for the window shows the
current progress of the image being generated (or the last complete image
generated).
* Added option to minimize the main window at startup.
* Added popup menu to control how the pattern is installed on your monitor
(using the same options available in the Desktop preference pane). The default
it "Tile".
* Added a numeric prefix to the display names in the "For:" monitor popup. This
should restore secondary monitor(s) to the menu when there were matching names
(such as "Apple Studio Display").

Version 1.0b1 - 02/18/03
========================
Initial public release.
